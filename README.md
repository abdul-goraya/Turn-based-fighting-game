# Turn-based-fighting-game
Description: 

A turn-based role-playing game where users have to signup and login using their unique username and password after which they can access levels according to the points, they have earned by defeating different monsters in each level. Using level-based progression enemies yield rewarding points which increase health, damage and number of health potions. While in combat, users can heal their health by consuming a potion or attack the monster during their turn after which the turn is switched to monster enemy. The enemy, then, utilizes a fundamental and simple artificial intelligence to either attack or heal. Upon completion of a level, the user will be rewarded with points which will be added to their points pool. Users can check their progress and compete against each other by checking the leaderboard. The leaderboard is rendered such that the user with the highest points will be displayed at the top followed by the rest of the users according to their points. If users are facing difficulties with the completion of a level, they may be able to grind previously completed levels to gain more points to level up their health, damage and health potions. The game is also designed to keep replayability in mind such that the enemy is also given an increased number of potions according to the userâ€™s points.
